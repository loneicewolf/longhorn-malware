## Malware Samples

For the malware itself, please visit [**ONLY_MALWARE**](https://github.com/loneicewolf/longhorn-malware/tree/ONLY_MALWARE).

- If you see `need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)`, you need to install `engrampa` on Linux. I use [Your Environment] for malware and Engrampa to pack infected archives.
